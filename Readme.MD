# Vash

Vash is a small tool that allows users to convert video files into a gradient collage containing all the colors in that video.

For example, the short video [linked here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqC2lO3Yy_4&list=PLPPomK5QKeyWV7PYC9s-PxrDhVIDpt4Oe) will have the following output:

<img src="./ReadmeImages/mosaic.png" width="400">

Please note that this tool is currently a prototype and enhanced functionality and performance improvements are currently being worked on. 

Vash was written in C++ with the aid of the OpenCV library.
